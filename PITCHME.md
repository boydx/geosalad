### Base mapping and geometry measurement

#HSLIDE
## Geometry measurement
* Length, area, and perimeter most common
* Unit of measure in the CRS

#HSLIDE
## ArcGIS File Geodatabase
* Automatically maintains geometry measures
* ```Shape_Length``` is length of line segment or perimeter of polygon
* ```Shape_Area``` is area of polygon


#HSLIDE
## Calculate Geometry...
* A tool in an ArcMap vector Attribute Table to add geometry measurements
* Select the CRS of the Data Frame or layer

#HSLIDE
# How many acres is campus?

#HSLIDE
## Compare area in these CRS
* EPSG: 3857
* EPSG: 3089
* EPSG: 6350

#HSLIDE
## Why are they different?



#HSLIDE
## Area measurement in raster layers
* Consult layer's CRS for cell size and unit of measure
* since each grid cell is the same size.
* Count of grid cells
