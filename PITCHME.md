# Raster data
### matrix of cell values

#HSLIDE
## Simple data model
* Cell size used to calculate area
* Cell values are numeric and represent a magnitude or a type
	* E.g., elevation versus land cover


#HSLIDE
# Cell numbers!
### Correctly interpreting numbers associated with cell values.

#HSLIDE
## Cell values
* Resolution: it's size on the ground.
* Bit depth: 2<sup>n</sup> number of distinct values
* Integer vs. ratio values?


#HSLIDE
## Levels of measurement
### to assign numeric values to real-world things.


#HSLIDE
## Nominal type
* Numbers represent unranked categories, e.g., land cover type
* Avoid symbology that implies preference or order

#HSLIDE
## Ordinal type
* Numbers represent ranked categories, e.g., suitability 
* Rank is not magnitude, e.g., 2 is not twice as much as 1

#HSLIDE
## Interval type
* Numbers represent continuous range with arbitrary scale, e.g., temperature
* 20&deg; is not twice as hot as 10&deg;

#HSLIDE
## Ratio type
* Numbers represent continuous range of quantities, e.g., elevation
* 200 feet is twice as high as 100 feet
