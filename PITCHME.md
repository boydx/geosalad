@ulend

## Arches, like Grays Arch, are formed by [differential weathering](https://kgs.uky.edu/kgsweb/olops/pub/kgs/GeoStory.pdf)

## River deltas
[300 million years ago](https://dinosaurpictures.org/ancient-earth/#300) this part of Kentucky was a coast with massive river deltas.

## Value
@ul[squares]
* A value is data that we use in our program. 
* All values have a distinct type.
* Many different types of value.
@ulend

---
## Basic types
@ul[squares]
* String
* Integer
* Float
* Can you identify their properties?
@ulend


---
## Levels of Measurement
@ul[squares]
* When you see an integer don't assume it's a quantity.
* Nominal
* Ordinal
* Ratio 
@ulend


---
## Constants
Literals: the syntax tells us what type it is.

---
```python
"I am a literally a string of characters"
1.0 # I'm a float value
1 # Just an integer!
```

---
## Objects
Once a value is created, it is an object with properties and powers üîå (actually they're called methods).

---
```python
"I am a literally a string of characters".upper()
# returns 'I AM A LITERALLY A STRING OF CHARACTERS'
```

---
## Variables
Assign value to an arbitrary and limited set of characters.

---
## Variables
Make meaningful variable names, e.g., not var1, 1var, or one of the reserved keywords.

---
```python
myZipcode = "40588"
# type() is a function
# Functions have () where we can accept input.
type(myZipcode)
# returns str
```

---
## Type
Knowing the *type* of value tells you methods üîå the value has. View [string methods](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_string.asp)

---
```python
myZipcode = "40588"
# Test to see if it only contains numbers
myZipcode.isnumeric()
# returns True
```

## Challenge
Let's place with some text. Fire up a new notebook and copy the following text...

---
## Assignment operators
### Assign value to variables

---
## Assigns right to left
# =

---
## Adds right to left
# +=

---
```python
x = 1
# x must be assigned first!
x += 6
```

---
## Comparison operators
### Returns `True` or `False`

---
## Equality
# ==
True if same value

---
## Identity
# is
Same value, type, and object

---
```python
x = 1
y = 1.0
z = x
x == y # True
x is y # False
z is x # True
```

---
## Inequality
# !=
True if different value

---
## When to use?
# == !=
As long as it is *not equal to* x, continue working!

---
## Membership operators
### Returns `True` or `False`

---
## String sequence in
# in
True if substring in string

---
```python
place = "Grays Arch"
"Gray" in place # True
"gray" in place # False
"gray" not in place # True
```

---
## Logical operators
### Returns `True` or `False`
Combine other comparisons

---
```python
place = "Grays Arch"
"Gray" in place or "gray" in place # True
"Gray" in place and "arch" in place # False
"Gray" in place and "Arch" in place # True
```

# Challenge

---
### Contouring program
The new [KyTopo Map](http://kygeonet.ky.gov/) uses the new lidar data to create new statewide topographic maps. The 40-ft contour interval is indexed every fifth contour, or 200 ft. Determine if any value is an index.

---
## Modulus operator
# % 
Divides left by right and returns remainder

---
```python
contourInterval = 40
contour = 120
print(countour % contourInterval) # returns 0. It's a contour!
```

---
## Input function
# input("str") 
Creates string from user input

---
```python
contour = input("Contour value: ")
print(contour)
```

---
## Convert to integer
# int("string") 
Create integer from string

---
```python
contour_remainder = int(contour)%40
```

---
### if statement
## if condition true:
Execute code body when true

---
```python
if contour_remainder == 0:
    print("Contour!") # Indent four spaces
```

---
### if/else statement
## else:
Execute code body when false

---
```python
if contour_remainder == 0:
    print("Contour!") # Indent four spaces
else: 
    print("Not a contour!")
```

---
### if/elif/else statement
## elif condition true:
Else if this condition is true execute code body

---
```python
if contour_remainder == 0:
    print("Contour!") # Indent four spaces
elif contour_remainder == 1:
    print("Close!")
else: 
    print("Not a contour!")
```

---
## if/elif/else statement
### Only one branch is true and executes

---
## if/if/if statement
### All branches could be true

---
## Errors
Anticipate and prevent

---
# Syntax
# Exception
# Logic

---
## Syntax
Incorrect sequence of charactors

---
## Exceptions
Syntactically correct but still flawed.
"John is a married bachelor." Can't be true!

---
### try/except statement
## Prevent exceptions
If it works continue, if it blows up let's do something else

---
```python
try:
    countInt = int(contour)
    if countInt % 40 == 0:
        print("Yup!")
except:
    print("not a number, yo!")
```
@[1-4]
@[5-6]

---
### Exceptions can be
## good
because they can teach you.


---
### Prevent errors of
## logic
The program executes properly, but the result isn't valid.

---
```python
elevKY = 6400
elevKY % 40 == 0 # True! But not for KY. Why?
```

@ulend

---
## Modules
@ul
* Import additional functions
* Extend [built-in functions](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_functions.asp)

with open(myData) as csvFile:
    # Create the CSV object. 
    reader = csv.reader(csvFile, delimiter='|')
    # Loop through records and print them.
    for row in reader:
        # Each row is a list of values.
        print(row)
